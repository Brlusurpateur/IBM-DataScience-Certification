--> Practice Quiz: Lesson 1 From Understanding to Preparation

1. In the case study, during the Data Understanding stage, data scientists discovered that not all the expected congestive heart failure admissions were being captured. What action did they take to resolve the issue?

    The data scientist looped back to the Data Collection stage, adding secondary and tertiary diagnoses, and built a more comprehensive definition of congestive heart failure admission

2. Select the correct statements that describe what data scientists do during the Data Preparation stage.

    During the Data Preparation stage, data scientists define the variables to be used in the model.

3. Select the correct statement about the Data Preparation stage of the data science methodology.

    The Data preparation stage incolces handling missing and improperly coded data and can include using text analysis to structure unstructured or semi-structured text data

4. In the case study, while working through the Data Preparation stage, data scientists learned that the initial definition did not capture all expected congestive heart failure admissions.

    False
